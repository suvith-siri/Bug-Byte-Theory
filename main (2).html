         <h3><b>INTRODUCTION:-</b></h3> <br>
          <ul><li>The well recognized principle of sustainable development for the protection and improvement of environment has been unanimously accepted by the world countries as a strategy that caters to the needs of the present without depriving the future generations of their right to available natural resources. </li><br>
              <li>It has been rightly said that sustainable development is meant to secure a balance between developmental activities for the benefits of the people and environmental protection and therefore, “it is a guarantee to the present and bequeath to the future generations.”</li><br>
              <li>The principle of sustainable development seeks to harmonise the conflict between development which may be industrial, economic or social, and right to healthy environment. </li><br>
              <li>The principle of sustainable development emphasises on two basic needs, firstly, need for socio-economic development and secondly, need of limitation imposed on the environment's capability to cope with the present and future requirements.
              <li>In other words, the balance between environmental protection and developmental activities could only be maintained by strictly adhering to the principle of sustainable development.</li><br>
              <li>Environmental studies have shown that the environment related problems of developed countries are mainly due to industrial and technological development whereas undeveloped countries have environmental problems because of poverty, over-population and illiteracy. </li><br>
              <li>Undoubtedly, encouragement and boost to developmental activities is in the socio-economic interest of a nation but this should not be at the cost of environmental degradation, because this will not only affect the present generation but have its adverse impact on the future generations. </li><br>
              <li>Therefore, sustainable development is the need of time so that development and environmental protection, both proceed maintaining a balance.</li><br>
              <li>‘Development’ has been recognized as a human right under Rio- Declaration of 1992. But all the nations (parties) participating in this summit unanimously agreed that economic or industrial development should be carried out in a manner that it does not adversely affect the environment because environmental pollution is a potential danger to human life and in that case, what is the use of such development? It is for this reason that the principle of sustainable development was evolved in this world summit for maintaining a balance between development and environment, and it was realised that both should go hand in hand.

<h3><b>What is Sustainable Development?</b></h3><br>
<ul><li>The principle of sustainable development has evolved on the basic assumption of co-existence of two apparently conflicting notions i.e. development and environment. But from the practical point of view, ecological, economic and social aspects of sustainability are inseparable. </li><br>
<li>As William Rees has rightly pointed out that maintenance of ecological integrity has to be accorded primacy over achievement of socio-economic human needs, thus there should be a convergence between ecological and economic factors in the developmental process.</li><br>
<li>The principle of sustainable development emphasises on two basic needs, firstly, need for socio-economic development and secondly, need of limitation imposed on the environment's capability to cope with the present and future requirements.</li><br>
</ul>

<h3><b>BASIC OBJECTIVES OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT:-</b></h3><br>
<ul><li>The principle of sustainable development seeks to achieve the following three basic objectives:</li><br>
  (1) to maintain production of goods and services for development and efficiency<br>
  (2) conversation and management of neutral resources including preservation of bio-diversity and maintenance of biological integrity<br>
  (3) maintenance and enhancement of the quality of life adopting the principle of equitable distribution of wealth and material resources.<br>
  <li>These objective may respectively be called as economic, environmental and social objectives of the principle of sustainable development.</li><br>
  <li>From the environmental point of view, the objective of the principle of sustainable development centres round three issues, namely</li><br>
  (i) to maintain essential ecological processes,<br>
  (ii) to preserve genetic diversity; and<br>
 (iii) to secure sustainable utilization of species and ecosystems.<br></ul>


 <h3><b>Scope of Extent of Sustainable Development:-</b></h3><br>
 <ul><li>Sustainable development involves a multi-faceted approach i.e. (1) economic, (2) human, (3) environmental, and (4) technological. It is a process which seeks to bring improvement in the quality of human life alongwith conservation of the ecological system. Thus, development and environment, both are inter-dependent and therefore, there cannot be development without protection of environment, nor can there be conservation of environment without development.</li><br>
 <li>The former U.N. General-Secretary Kofi-Annan had identified five areas for the applicability of the principle of sustainable development. They are (1) water, (2) health, (3) power and energy, (4) Agriculture and (5) Bio-diversity.</li><br></ul>

 <h3><b>Salient Principles of Sustainable Development:-</b></h3>
 <ul><li>The principle of sustainable development which received international recognition as a result of Brundtland Commission Report (1987) was overwhelmingly supported by all the nations. Some of the salient principles which underlie the concept of sustainable development were spelled out in the Rio Declaration, 1992 and Agenda 21. Therefore, these principles have got to be necessarily followed in order to achieve the objective of sustainable development. These principles are as follows:</li><br>
   (1) Inter-generational equity;<br>(2) Use and conservation of natural resources;<br>(3) Environmental protection;<br>(4) The precautionary principle;<br>(5) The ‘Polluter Pays’ principle;<br>(6) Principle of liability to help and co-operate;<br>(7) Poverty eradication; and<br>(8) Principle of ‘public trust’.<br></ul>

   <h3><b>Conclusion:-</b></h3><br>
   <ul><li>It is true that in order to improve and protect the environment from pollution sustainability must be there between environment and development. </li><br>
   <li>The concept of sustainable development based on the notion that natural resources should be exploited for the benefit of both present and future generation.  As we know that increased industrial activity worldwide requires the use of natural resources which are depleting day by day. </li><br>
   <li>It is also true that the need for resource conservation, efficient use of resources and environment friendly corporate policies and behaviour has now been recognised worldwide. </li><br>
   <li>The country needs an Environmental policy and planning, while being globally sensitive must be based on local needs. Finally, if sustainable development has to move from mere wishful thinking and slogan-mongering into a reality, the world (developed and developing) as a whole has to move towards a new world order in which new economic and technological orders are dovetailed. </li><br>
   <li>Such an order has to be aimed at benefiting the poor because in the chain of sustainable development, the weakest links are poverty and inequality. Last but not least, if the principles of sustainable development are followed then definitely with the economic growth and industrial development of a country environment protection can be maintained.</li><br></ul>
