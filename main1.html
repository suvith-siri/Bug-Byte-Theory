	<h3><b>Start of Agriculture:-</b></h3></br>
	<ul><li>Over centuries, the growth of agriculture contributed to the rise of civilizations.</li></br>
	
	<li>Before agriculture became widespread, people spent most of their lives searching for food—hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants. About 11,500 years ago, people gradually learned how to grow cereal and root crops, and settled down to a life based on farming.</li></br>
	
	<li>By 2,000 years ago, much of the Earth’s population had become dependent on agriculture. Scholars are not sure why this shift to farming took place, but it may have occurred because of climate change.</li></br>
	
	<li>When people began growing crops, they also began herding and breeding wild animals. Adapting wild plants and animals for people to use is called domestication.</li></br>
	
	<li>The first domesticated plant was probably rice or corn. Chinese farmers were cultivating rice as early as 7500 BCE.</li></br>
	<li>The first domesticated animals were dogs, which were used for hunting. Sheep and goats were probably domesticated next. People also domesticated cattle and pigs. Most of these animals had once been hunted for hides and meat. Now many of them are also sources of milk, cheese, and butter. Eventually, people used domesticated animals such as oxen for plowing, pulling, and transportation.</li></br>
	
	<li>Agriculture enabled people to produce surplus food. They could use this extra food when crops failed or trade it for other goods. Food surpluses allowed people to work at other tasks unrelated to farming.</li></br>
	
	<li>Agriculture kept formerly nomadic people near their fields and led to the development of permanent villages. These became linked through trade. New economies were so successful in some areas that cities grew and civilizations developed. The earliest civilizations based on intensive agriculture arose near the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in Mesopotamia (now Iraq and Iran) and along the Nile River in Egypt.Improved Technology
	For thousands of years, agricultural development was very slow. One of the earliest agricultural tools was fire. Native Americans used fire to control the growth of berry-producing plants, which they knew grew quickly after a wildfire. Farmers cultivated small plots of land by hand, using axes to clear away trees and digging sticks to break up and till the soil. Over time, improved farming tools of bone, stone, bronze, and iron were developed. New methods of storage evolved. People began stockpiling foods in jars and clay-lined pits for use in times of scarcity. They also began making clay pots and other vessels for carrying and cooking food.</li></br>
	
	<li>Around 5500 BCE, farmers in Mesopotamia developed simple irrigation systems. By channeling water from streams onto their fields, farmers were able to settle in areas once thought to be unsuited to agriculture. In Mesopotamia, and later in Egypt and China, people organized themselves and worked together to build and maintain better irrigation systems.</li></br>
	
	<li>Early farmers also developed improved varieties of plants. For example, around 6000 BCE, a new variety of wheat arose in South Asia and Egypt. It was stronger than previous cereal grains; its hulls were easier to remove and it could be made into bread.</li></br>
	
	<li>As the Romans expanded their empire, they adapted the best agricultural methods of the people they conquered. They wrote manuals about the farming techniques they observed in Africa and Asia, and adapted them to land in Europe.</li></br>
	
	<li>The Chinese also adapted farming tools and methods from nearby empires. A variety of rice from Vietnam ripened quickly and allowed farmers to harvest several crops during a single growing season. This rice quickly became popular throughout China.</li></br>
	
	<li>Many medieval European farmers used an open-field system of planting. One field would be planted in spring, another in autumn, and one would be left unplanted, or fallow. This system preserved nutrients in the soil, increasing crop production.</li></br>
	
	<li>The leaders of the Islamic Golden Age (which reached its height around 1000) in North Africa and the Middle East made agriculture into a science. Islamic Golden Age farmers learned crop rotation.</li></br>
	
	<li>In the 15th and 16th centuries, explorers introduced new varieties of plants and agricultural products into Europe. From Asia, they carried home coffee, tea, and indigo, a plant used to make blue dye. From the Americas, they took plants such as potatoes, tomatoes, corn (maize), beans, peanuts, and tobacco. Some of these became staples and expanded people’s diets.</li></br>
	
	<h3><b>Start of Agriculture:-</b></h3></br>
	
	<li>The following are 10 best agri countries that are producing the best food commodities in the world. Have a look at agricultural producing countries.</li></br>
	<h3><b>1. CHINA</b></h3></br>
	<li>China has 7% of the arable land and with that, they feed 22% of the world’s population. In the 20th century, China struggled to feed its large population. After that, upgrading farming policies and technologies made china big-time self-sufficiency and growth. China’s top economic planning body alert that this would be difficult to keep.</li></br>
	<h3><b>Agriculture in China</b></h3></br>
	<li>China’s land is highly employed for agriculture</li></br>
	<li>Vegetables are planted in China, on the roads, and on many building walls.</li></br>
	<li>In 1949, China lost ⅕ of its arable land, and now only 10% to 15% of China’s land is adequate for agriculture</li></br>
	<li>545,960 square kilometers of land is irrigated in China.</li></br>
	<li>China is the largest rice-producing country in the world. With this, they produced soybeans, kaoliang (sorghum), wheat, millet, and corn.</li></br>
	<h3><b>2. United States</b></h3></br>
	<li>The United States is known for its agriculture science and provides some advanced agriculture technology in the world. It proves a role model for many countries in the agriculture sector, and the United States agriculture is developing continually with increasing rates. Developing here refers to scientific soil, crop analysis, more innovative machinery, and increased use of computers. In short, we can say that the United States is the best country in agriculture technology.</li></br>

It has an entire land of 2.1 billion acres and the area occupied by farming is almost 867.4 million acres in Brazil. The country’s initial production priority was on sugarcane. Brazilian started farming some 12,000 years ago, with many crops including sweet potatoes, maize, peanuts, tobacco, and many more.</li></br>
	<h3><b>Agriculture in Brazil</b></h3></br>
	<li>In the production of sugarcane, Brazil is the world leader, and it produces 600 million-plus tonnes every year.</li></br>

	<li>Brazil is the globe’s largest exporter of coffee, beef, ethanol, and soybean.</li></br>
	<li>Around 7% of Brazil’s land area is utilized for crop production that includes soybeans.⅓ of the planet’s oranges are produced in Brazil.</li></br>
	<h3><b>Agriculture in Brazil</b></h3></br>  
	<li>Indian agriculture provides around 58% of livelihood to Indians. In recent data, agriculture is the primary source of income for half of the population that contributed 17% to 18% to their GDP. And, Indian is the largest producer of most of the fruits in the world that includes bananas, guava, mango, lemon, papaya, and vegetables including chickpea. India produced spices too, that include ginger, pepper, and chili.</li></br>

	<h3><b>Agriculture in Japan</b></h3></br>
	<li>In Japan, there are two significant types of agriculture fields which are siden and tambo.</li></br>
	<li>From 6.09 million hectares in 1961 to 4.65 million hectares in 2006, the area under cultivation dropped in Japan.</li></br>
	<li>In Japan, approx 2 lakh hectares of land is idle, and rice production decreased by 20% in the past years.</li></br>
	<li>Japan’s self-sufficiency food ratio fell from 78% in 1961 to 39% in 2006. Now Japan’s government wants to increase it to 50%.</li></br>

	<h3><b>Positive and Negative Impacts of Modern Agricultural Techniques</b></h3></br>
	<h3><b>Positive Impacts:</b></h3></br>
	<li>(i) Significantly increased yield per acre, per person and per dollar relative to extensive farming and therefore,\n
	
	(ii) Food becomes more affordable to the consumer as it costs less to produce.
	
	(iv) The preservation of existing areas of woodland and rain forest habitats (and the ecosystems and other sustainable economies that these may harbour), which would need to be felled for extensive farming methods in the same geographical location. This also leads to a reduction in anthropomorphic CO2 generation (resulting from removal of the sequestration afforded by woodlands and rain forests)
	
	(v) In case of intensive line stock farming, an opportunity to capture methane emissions which would otherwise contribute to global warming. Once captured, these emissions can be used to generate heat and electrical energy, thereby reducing local demand for fossil and fuels.
	</li></br>
	<h3><b>Negative Impacts:</b></h3></br>
	<li>(i) Limits or destroys the natural habitat of most wild creatures, and leads to soil erosion.
	
	(ii) Use of fertilizers can alter the biology of rivers and lakes. Some environmentalists attribute the hypoxic zone in the Gulf of Mexico as being encouraged by nitrogen fertilization of the algae bloom.
	
	(iii) Pesticides generally kill useful insects as well as those destroy crops.
	
	(iii) The same area of land is able to supply food and fibre for a larger population reducing the risk of starvation.
	
	(iv ) Is often not sustainable if not properly managed-may result in desertification, or land that is 20 poisonous and eroded that nothing else will grow there.
	
	(v) Requires large amounts of energy input to produce, transport and apply chemical fertilizers/pesticides,
	
	(vi) The chemicals used may leave the field as run off eventually ending up in rivers and lakes or may drain into groundwater aquifers.
	
	(vii) Use of pesticides have numerous negative health effects in workers who apply them, people that line nearby the area of application or downstream/downwind from it, and consumers who eat the pesticides which remain on their food.
